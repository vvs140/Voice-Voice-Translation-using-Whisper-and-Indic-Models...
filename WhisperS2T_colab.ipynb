It is commonly practiced in arid regions of the world. Dryland horticulture or dryland farming is practiced in places with poor soil condition. The soil fertility is less and frequent droughts are present and the fertilizers are also less in use in this dryland farming. So now there are some of the practices that are done to overcome the challenges in a dryland horticulture. Soil moisture is the main limiting factor in a dryland horticulture. So to overcome these challenges there are some of the management practices like the using of mulches. About 60 to 70% of the rainfall is lost through this evaporation and transpiration. So using these mulches would help to reduce the water loss from the soil. Now there are also different types of mulches like the straw mulch, stubble mulch or the black polythene mulch is present to is there to overcome all these water evaporation challenges. The plastic mulch is made from a polyethylene film. The straw mulches are those made from straws and also from other crop residues. This straw especially the straws are used after cultivation. This straws are placed it also helps in reducing the weed population because this straw mulch and the other crop residues the mulch will help to absorb the moisture in the soil and it will also maintain the temperature and it would lead to less water evaporation.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Method 2\n"],"metadata":{"id":"bqCJ3VLEdm8o"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Mount Drive\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"FpTSg93Yd35K","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755863052697,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":24546,"user":{"displayName":"Venkata Sarath Chandra Galla ic40044","userId":"08935175430182167547"}},"outputId":"77064c64-4288-4088-c19a-d67dc1919e5a"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Run Whisper CLI on video/audio file\n","!whisper \"/content/drive/MyDrive/2F.mp4\" --model small --output_dir \"/content/drive/MyDrive/\""],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"t8UuBgpaevcJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1755844635930,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":21974,"user":{"displayName":"Venkata Sarath Chandra Galla ic40044","userId":"08935175430182167547"}},"outputId":"9cd163c6-23ea-4e7b-9f17-0b13df834d45"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Detecting language using up to the first 30 seconds.
